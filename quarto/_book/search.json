One simply calculates the change in specific humidity between equally spaced periods along the trajectory.\nThis method comes from Sodemann, Schwierz, and Wernli (2008).\nI think it might be interesting to plot symbols on the trajectory map that show moisture uptake (blue = evaporation) and moisture loss (blue = precipitation; color represent gain and loss to the atmosphere). Think about color choices here…\nDetermine the cloud-base height at each trajectory time. (This can be done using the CL61 summary files at 15 minute resolution.) Then select the vertical level that is closest to the cloud-base height. Plot all of these trajectories together to determine if they might be categorized. Determine the SOMs that are associated with the resulting categories; see below.\nDetermine the SOMs that are associated with each near-surface trajectory. I suspect that some SOMs will the associated with precipitation along the trajectory and some won’t.\nUse the methods of Hermann, Papritz, and Wernli (2020) to analyze multiple trajectories across the SW region of Greenland for the summer of 2024 to investigate how representative the SLEIGH measurements are. A lot of cool research questions here:",
