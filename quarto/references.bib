  abstract = {Since temperature extremes have a strong impact on environment and society, it is crucial to understand their underlying mechanisms. While their relationship to the large-scale atmospheric circulation has been comprehensively investigated, the role of physical processes in the formation of air masses with extreme temperatures is less well understood. This study presents a Lagrangian analysis of the 0.1\% most extreme six-hourly hot and cold events in three European regions (UK, Central Europe, Balkans) for the time period 1989--2009. The results provide insight into typical transport patterns and physical processes (adiabatic compression, radiation, surface heat fluxes) occurring along the trajectories of extreme temperature air masses. Cold events in Europe are most frequently induced by advection of cold air masses from the Arctic and Russia. The transport to the target region is characterized by a temperature increase caused by adiabatic compression and, in the maritime setting of the UK, also by diabatic heating due to surface sensible heat fluxes. Despite the warming along the trajectories, the extremeness of the associated 2 m temperature increases, due to the dislocation of the air mass to regions with a milder climate. Hot events are generally associated with weaker horizontal transport, but strong adiabatic warming and local temperature increase caused by enhanced radiation and surface heat fluxes. This in situ warming is particularly strong in Central Europe. Evaluating the temperature evolution along the trajectories reveals that hot and cold extremes develop on a similar time-scale of 2--3 days. This time-scale is mostly set by physical processes for hot extremes and controlled by advective transport for cold extremes. The diagnostics applied in this study lead to an improved process understanding that can provide a basis for more accurate predictions of temperature extremes.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} In this study, we systematically investigate the dynamical and thermodynamic processes that lead to 77 large-scale melt events affecting high-elevation regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) in June--August (JJA) 1979--2017. For that purpose, we compute 8\&thinsp;d kinematic backward trajectories from the lowermost {$\sim$}500\&thinsp;m above the GrIS during these events. The key synoptic feature accompanying the melt events is an upper-tropospheric ridge southeast of the GrIS associated with a surface high-pressure system. This circulation pattern is favorable to induce rapid poleward transport (up to 40\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} latitude) of warm ({$\sim$}15\&thinsp;K warmer than climatological air masses arriving on the GrIS) and moist air masses from the lower troposphere to the western GrIS and subsequently to distribute them in the anticyclonic flow over north and east Greenland. During transport to the GrIS, the melt event air masses cool by {$\sim$}15\&thinsp;K due to ascent and radiation, which keeps them just above the critical threshold to induce melting. The thermodynamic analyses reveal that the final warm anomaly of the air masses is primarily owed to anomalous horizontal transport from a climatologically warm region of origin. However, before being transported to the GrIS, i.e., in their region of origin, these air masses were not anomalously warm. Latent heating from condensation of water vapor, occurring as the airstreams are forced to ascend orographically or dynamically, is of secondary importance. These characteristics were particularly pronounced during the most extensive melt event in early July 2012, where, importantly, the warm anomaly was not preserved from anomalously warm source regions such as North America experiencing a record heat wave. The mechanisms identified here are in contrast to melt events in the low-elevation high Arctic and to midlatitude heat waves, where adiabatic warming by large-scale subsidence is essential. Considering the impact of moisture on the surface energy balance, we find that radiative effects are closely linked to the air mass trajectories and enhance melt over the entire GrIS accumulation zone due to (i) enhanced downward longwave radiation related to poleward moisture transport and a shift in the cloud phase from ice to liquid primarily west of the ice divide and (ii) increased shortwave radiation in clear-sky regions east of the ice divide. Given the ongoing increase in the frequency and the melt extent of large-scale melt events, the understanding of upper-tropospheric ridges over the North Atlantic, i.e., also Greenland blocking, and its representation in climate models is crucial in determining future GrIS accumulation zone melt and thus global sea level rise.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

\textbf{Introduction}
\par
Goal of "study is to improve our understanding of the atmospheric dynamical processes leading to melt episodes that cover large parts of the GrIS accumulation zone.
\par
Two main objectives:
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item "Go beyond case studies and investigate large-scale melt events systematically" between 1979-2017.
\item "Investigate the history and thermodynamic evolution of air masses associated with large-scale melt events" using backtrajectory analysis.

\end{enumerate}

\par
See list of four questions.
\par
\textbf{Data and Methods}
\par
2.3 Backward Trajectories
\par
They used the analysis tool called LAGRANTO (from Wernli...)
\par
It's fairly easy to calculate adiabatic and diabatic temperature changes from HYSPLIT trajectories because potential temperature, air temperature and pressure are output; see /Users/vonw/work/proposals/2021/NSF\_AON\_ICECAPS-MELT/python/backTrajectoryTchange\_12July2012.py.
\par
\textbf{Detailed analysis of the melt event EV69}
\par
The synoptic situation was important; two distinct periods.
\par
Relation to 2021 ICECAPS-MELT proposal
\par
Given the increase in frequency of melt events, it is important to understand processes connected to the upper tropospheric ridging (Greenland blocking).
\par
We propose to make surface observations that improve understanding of the processes that were identified in this paper as important.
\par
Note that Section 3 in Hermann et al. is really what we want to do: detailed analysis of case studies at Summit and Dye-2. We could focus on both "normal" conditions" and both warm and cold "extreme events"; synoptic situation, air mass origin, air mass evolution, linkage to cloud and radiative effects; we can add turbulent fluxes
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item Long-range transport (using backtrajectory analysis similar to that performed in this study)
\item Latent heat release
\item Enhanced DLW
\item Shift in cloud phase

\end{enumerate}

\par
What can we do with Eulerian point measurements and Lagrangian trajectories?
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item Back trajectories allow us to connect processes over the GrIS to synoptic conditions. Hermann et al. (2020) and many others clearly show that the synoptic conditions are important to large melt events.
\item We can compare our site measurements to models and reanalyses in an Eulerian reference frame.
\item We can also use back trajectory analysis to better understand how air is modified as it reaches Greenland. This is especially important for precipitation, and how cloud formation modulates net radiation, which then affects the SEB. So, we get information on both SEB and SMB. HOWEVER, models typically don't reproduce the measurements.
\item We can classify our data into SOMs. This is similar to grouping trajectories and identifying source regions. It is important for modelers to understand where air is coming from prior to reaching the GrIS, and then what happens to the air once it reaches the GrIS; SMB/SEB processes.
\item 
\par
So, the key seems to be what processes we'll be able to investigate with the new platform.
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item Precipitation type and amount
\item Presence of liquid water clouds
\item Subsurface temperatures and melt/refreezing
\item In addition to normal stuff; sfc met, rad, turb heat fluxes

@article{papritzMoistureOriginTransport2022,
	abstract = {A substantial portion of the moisture transport into the Arctic occurs in episodic, high-amplitude events with strong impacts on the Arctic's climate system components such as sea ice. This study focuses on the origin of such moist-air intrusions during winter and examines the moisture sources, moisture transport pathways, and their linkage to the driving large-scale circulation patterns. For that purpose, 597 moist-air intrusions, defined as daily events of intense (exceeding the 90th anomaly percentile) zonal mean moisture transport into the polar cap ({$\geq$}70{$\circ$} N), are identified. Kinematic backward trajectories combined with a Lagrangian moisture source diagnostic are then used to pinpoint the moisture sources and characterize the airstreams accomplishing the transport.  The moisture source analyses show that the bulk of the moisture transported into the polar cap during these moist-air intrusions originates in the eastern North Atlantic with an uptake maximum poleward of 50{$\circ$} N. Trajectories further reveal an inverse relationship between moisture uptake latitude and the level at which moisture is injected into the polar cap, consistent with ascent of poleward-flowing air in a baroclinic atmosphere. Focusing on intrusions in the North Atlantic (424 intrusions), we find that lower tropospheric moisture transport is predominantly accomplished by two types of airstreams: (i) cold, polar air warmed and moistened by surface fluxes and (ii) air subsiding from the mid-troposphere into the boundary layer. Both airstreams contribute about 36 \% each to the total transport. The former accounts for most of the moisture transport during intrusions associated with an anomalously high frequency of cyclones east of Greenland (218 intrusions), whereas the latter is more important in the presence of atmospheric blocking over Scandinavia and the Ural Mountains (145 events). Long-range moisture transport, accounting for 17 \% of the total transport, dominates during intrusions with weak forcing by baroclinic weather systems (64 intrusions). Finally, mid-tropospheric moisture transport is invariably associated with (diabatically) ascending air and moisture origin in the central and western North Atlantic, including the Gulf Stream front, accounting for roughly 10 \% of the total transport. In summary, our study shows that moist-air intrusions into the polar atmosphere result from a combination of airstreams with predominantly high-latitude or high-altitude origin, whose relative importance is determined by the underlying driving weather systems (i.e., cyclones and blocks).},

  abstract = {We present a new Lagrangian diagnostic for identifying the sources of water vapor for precipitation. Unlike previous studies, the method allows for a quantitative demarcation of evaporative moisture sources. This is achieved by taking into account the temporal sequence of evaporation into and precipitation from an air parcel during transport, as well as information on its proximity to the boundary layer. The moisture source region diagnostic was applied to trace the origin of water vapor for winter precipitation over the Greenland ice sheet for 30 selected months with pronounced positive, negative, and neutral North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' ERA-40 reanalysis data. The North Atlantic and the Nordic seas proved to be the by far dominant moisture sources for Greenland. The location of the identified moisture sources in the North Atlantic basin strongly varied with the NAO phase. More specifically, the method diagnosed a shift from sources north of Iceland during NAO positive months to a maximum in the southeastern North Atlantic for NAO negative months, qualitatively consistent with changes in the concurrent large-scale mean flow. More long-range moisture transport was identified during the NAO negative phase, leading to the advection of moisture from more southerly locations. Different regions of the Greenland ice sheet experience differing changes in the average moisture source locations; variability was largest in the north and west of Greenland. The strong moisture source variability for Greenland winter precipitation with the NAO found here can have a large impact on the stable isotope composition of Greenland precipitation and hence can be important for the interpretation of stable isotope data from ice cores. In a companion paper, the implications of the present results are further explored in that respect.},

	abstract = {During the first half of August 2002, a sequence of extreme precipitation episodes affected many regions of central and southern Europe, culminating in one of the most severe flooding events ever experienced along sections of the river Elbe and its tributaries. In this paper, the synoptic meteorological situation during the primary flooding event, 11-13 August 2002, and its recent background is illustrated and discussed. Then, backward trajectory modelling of water vapour transport is employed to determine the sources and transport pathways of the moisture which rained out during the event. The Lagrangian trajectory model FLEXTRA is used together with high resolution operational meteorological analyses from the ECMWF to track a very large number of trajectories, initialized in a dense three-dimensional grid array over the extreme rainfall region. Specific humidity changes along each trajectory are mapped out to yield source-receptor relationships between evaporation and subsequent precipitation for the event. Regions of significant surface evaporation of moisture which later rained out were determined to be parts of the Aegean and Ligurian Seas during the initial stages of the event, while strong evaporation from eastern European land surfaces and from the Black Sea became dominant later on. The method also provides precipitation estimates based solely on specific humidity changes along Lagrangian airmass trajectories, which can be compared to ECMWF model forecast precipitation estimates.},
